## Improved Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Builds on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in `monte-carlo`.

- More or less a direct rewrite of the original code, but with clearer design
- Uses migrates from Python 2 to 3, and uses more modern language features
- Improved termination condition handling
- More generic; doesn't include any hardcoded environment variables or information about ciphertext
